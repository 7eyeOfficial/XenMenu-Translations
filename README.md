# XenMenu Translations
If you'd like to make an addition to this GitHub, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request. If you're not sure how to do this, please have a look at [this GitHub help article](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).

### Notes
- Please make sure the encoding of your file is UTF-8. If the encoding is not UTF-8, the translation will fail to load. You will know if the encoding is incorrect when you see characters like "�" appear where special characters like "ü" should appear.
- Please make sure the JSON syntax is correct. You can check this by using [JSON Lint](https://jsonlint.com/). If the JSON syntax is incorrect, the translation will fail to load. If JSON Lint displays any validation errors, please make sure to fix them before submitting a pull request or commit.
- Please make sure to keep your language updated. The menu is updating often and new entries are added before a new update is released. Please make sure the new entries are translated before the update is released. We appreciate your continued language support.
- If you have any suggestions regarding changed formatting (colors, wording, etc.) please contact us (see "Translation help") about any changes you want to make, before making any changes. We'd like for all files to be as consistent as possible to make maintaining all files as easy as possible.
- Please do not remove existing authors when updating files. You are always free to make edits to existing languages, but that does not mean you get to be the sole author of the language. Feel free to add yourself to the author line, though!
- Should there be any doubt about formality, choose an informal method of addressing the user. Please do not contact us with other language-specific questions. You are the translator and should be able to translate correctly.

### Contact
