### Translation notes
- Please make sure the encoding of your file is UTF-8. If the encoding is not UTF-8, the translation will fail to load. You will know if the encoding is incorrect when you see characters like "�" appear where special characters like "ü" should appear.
- Please make sure the JSON syntax is correct. You can check this by using [JSON Lint](https://jsonlint.com/). If the JSON syntax is incorrect, the translation will fail to load. If JSON Lint displays any validation errors, please make sure to fix them before submitting a pull request or commit.
- Please do not remove existing authors when updating files. You are always free to make edits to existing language, but that does not mean you get to be the sole author of the language. Feel free to add yourself to the author line!
